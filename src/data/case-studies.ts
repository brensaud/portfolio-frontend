    engineeringDecisions: [
      {
        question: 'Why FastAPI over Django or Flask?',
        answer:
          'FastAPI is async-first and integrates natively with Pydantic for request/response validation and OpenAPI schema generation. Django\'s ORM is synchronous; Flask lacks first-class async support. For a system where database and LLM calls are both I/O-bound, async throughout the stack is essential.',
        tradeoffs:
          'FastAPI has a smaller ecosystem than Django. Features like admin panels and auth middleware require third-party libraries or custom implementation, increasing initial build time.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why PostgreSQL and not a document database?',
        answer:
          'The data model has strong relational structure: Users → Profiles → Sessions → Questions → Answers → Feedback forms a clear hierarchy with referential integrity requirements. PostgreSQL enforces this with foreign keys and constraints. It also supports array columns (for `key_concepts`, `strengths`, `improvements`) without requiring a separate collection, and will support pgvector for semantic question similarity matching in a future iteration.',
        tradeoffs:
          'A document database like MongoDB would be more flexible for schema evolution, but at the cost of consistency guarantees that are important for billing and progress tracking.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why Celery + Redis for AI evaluation instead of FastAPI background tasks?',
        answer:
          'FastAPI\'s `BackgroundTasks` runs in the same process. If the server restarts mid-evaluation, the job is lost. Celery tasks are persisted in Redis and can be retried by any available worker. For an operation that costs money (OpenAI API call) and affects user progress data, durability is non-negotiable.',
        tradeoffs:
          'Celery adds operational complexity: a separate worker process, Redis dependency, and monitoring overhead (Flower). For a prototype, FastAPI BackgroundTasks would have been simpler — but not acceptable for a production SaaS.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why a provider-agnostic AI abstraction layer?',
        answer:
          'OpenAI\'s API costs and availability constraints make long-term dependence on a single provider a business risk. The abstraction layer (a Python Protocol) means swapping from OpenAI to Anthropic, Mistral, or a self-hosted model requires only a new implementation of the Protocol — zero changes to the service or worker layers.',
        tradeoffs:
          'The abstraction adds a layer of indirection that can obscure provider-specific features (e.g., structured outputs, tool use) that might not map cleanly across providers. Managed carefully by keeping the Protocol interface minimal.',
      },
      {
        question: 'Why UUID primary keys instead of auto-incrementing integers?',
        answer:
          'UUIDs prevent enumeration attacks (sequential IDs in URLs let attackers probe other users\' resources). They also support future distributed writes without a centralised sequence generator, which would become a bottleneck in a horizontally-scaled deployment.',
        tradeoffs:
          'UUIDs are larger (16 bytes vs. 4 bytes) and slower for B-tree index operations. Acceptable trade-off at this scale; revisitable with ULID if performance becomes an issue.',
